## 🤖 Multi-Agent Architecture

### **Agent 1: Ingest Agent**
**Purpose:** Accept and preprocess farmer inputs

**Implementation as Cloud Function:**
```javascript
// Function: ingestAgent
// Trigger: HTTP request from frontend

Input: {
  userId: string,
  imageFile: File,
  symptoms: string,
  language: 'en' | 'ur',
  location: {lat: number, lng: number}
}

Process:
1. Validate image (type, size)
2. Upload to Firebase Storage: /crop-images/{userId}/{timestamp}.jpg
3. Resize image to max 1024px width
4. Generate image URL
5. Create Firestore document in 'reports' collection:
   {
     userId,
     imageUrl,
     symptoms,
     language,
     location,
     status: 'processing',
     createdAt: serverTimestamp()
   }
6. Trigger coordinatorAgent with reportId
7. Return reportId to frontend

Error Handling:
- Invalid file type → "Please upload PNG or JPG image"
- File too large → "Image must be under 10MB"
- Upload failed → "Upload failed. Check internet connection"
```

### **Agent 2: Diagnostic Agent (RAG + Vision)**
**Purpose:** Analyze crop image and symptoms using Gemini Vision + RAG knowledge base

**Implementation as Cloud Function:**
```javascript
// Function: diagnosticAgent
// Trigger: Called by coordinatorAgent

Input: { reportId: string }

Process:
1. Fetch report from Firestore
2. Generate text embedding of symptoms using Gemini Embeddings API
3. Query Firestore 'diseases' collection using vector similarity search (top 3 matches)
4. Call Gemini 2.0 Flash Vision API with:
   - Image URL
   - Prompt: "You are an expert plant pathologist specializing in Pakistani crops (cotton, wheat, rice, sugarcane, maize). Analyze this image showing {symptoms}. Identify: 1) Disease/pest name, 2) Confidence score (0-100%), 3) Affected parts, 4) Severity (Low/Medium/High). Consider these similar cases from our database: {vectorSearchResults}. Respond in JSON format."
   
5. Parse Gemini response:
   {
     disease: string,
     confidence: number,
     affectedParts: string[],
     severity: 'Low' | 'Medium' | 'High',
     description: string
   }

6. Update Firestore report:
   {
     diagnosis: parsedResponse,
     status: 'diagnosed'
   }

7. If confidence < 70%, add clarifying questions:
   clarificationNeeded: ["Is there any white powdery substance?", "When did symptoms appear?"]

8. Log to agents_logs collection:
   {
     agentName: 'diagnosticAgent',
     action: 'diagnosis_completed',
     reportId,
     confidence: number,
     timestamp: serverTimestamp()
   }

9. Return diagnosis object

RAG Knowledge Base (Firestore 'diseases' collection):
- Document per disease (50-100 Pakistani crop diseases)
- Fields: name_en, name_ur, crops[], symptoms[], treatment, embedding[]
- Indexed for vector search using Vertex AI
```

### **Agent 3: Action Planner Agent**
**Purpose:** Generate localized treatment plans with PKR pricing

**Implementation as Cloud Function:**
```javascript
// Function: actionPlannerAgent
// Trigger: Called by coordinatorAgent after diagnosis

Input: { reportId: string }

Process:
1. Fetch report with diagnosis
2. Call Gemini 2.0 Flash with prompt:
   "Create a detailed treatment plan for {disease} in {crop}. 
   Context: Pakistani farmer with access to local agricultural shops.
   Include:
   - Immediate actions (24 hours)
   - Short-term treatment (1 week)
   - Long-term prevention
   - For each step: specific materials, dosage, application method, timing, safety precautions
   Format as JSON array of steps."

3. Parse Gemini response into structured steps
4. For each material mentioned:
   - Query Firestore 'products' collection for local availability
   - Fetch average price in PKR
   - Get common brand names in Pakistan

5. Calculate total estimated cost
6. Generate timeline (Day 1, Day 3, Week 2, etc.)

7. Update Firestore report:
   {
     treatmentPlan: {
       steps: [
         {
           stepNumber: 1,
           title: "Remove Infected Plants",
           description: "...",
           materials: ["Gloves", "Plastic bags"],
           cost: 200,
           timing: "Immediate",
           safetyNotes: "Wear protective gear"
         }
       ],
       totalCost: 2500,
       timeline: "2 weeks",
       preventionTips: []
     },
     status: 'treatment_planned'
   }

8. Log to agents_logs
9. Return treatment plan object

Pricing Database (Firestore 'products' collection):
- Common agricultural products in Pakistan
- Fields: name, type, avgPricePKR, unit, availability, brands[]
```

### **Agent 4: Marketplace Agent**
**Purpose:** Connect farmers to nearby suppliers and buyers

**Implementation as Cloud Function:**
```javascript
// Function: marketplaceAgent
// Trigger: Called by coordinatorAgent after treatment plan

Input: { 
  reportId: string,
  farmerLocation: {lat: number, lng: number}
}

Process:
1. Fetch report with treatment plan
2. Extract required materials list
3. Calculate geohash for farmer location (6 character precision ~1.2km)

4. Query Firestore 'suppliers' collection:
   - Filter: geohash starts with calculated prefix (nearby)
   - Filter: products array-contains-any requiredMaterials
   - Order by: rating DESC
   - Limit: 10

5. For each supplier:
   - Calculate haversine distance from farmer
   - Check stock availability
   - Get product-specific pricing
   - Format contact info (phone, WhatsApp link)

6. Sort by: (distance × 0.6) + (1/rating × 0.3) + (price × 0.1)

7. Update Firestore report:
   {
     suppliers: [
       {
         name: "Punjab Seed Corporation",
         distance: 5.2, // km
         products: ["Fungicide XYZ", "Sprayer"],
         totalCost: 2300,
         rating: 4.5,
         phone: "+92-300-1234567",
         whatsappLink: "https://wa.me/923001234567"
       }
     ],
     status: 'marketplace_ready'
   }

8. Log to agents_logs
9. Return suppliers array

Suppliers Database (Firestore 'suppliers' collection):
- Mock data for MVP (15-20 suppliers across Punjab)
- Fields: name, location (geopoint), geohash, products[], prices{}, rating, phone, verified
- Indexed: geohash, rating
```

### **Agent 5: Weather Monitor Agent (Bonus Feature)**
**Purpose:** Proactive alerts based on weather conditions

**Implementation as Scheduled Cloud Function:**
```javascript
// Function: weatherMonitorAgent
// Trigger: Scheduled (every 6 hours via Cloud Scheduler)

Process:
1. Fetch all active users from Firestore
2. Group users by unique locations (geohash level 4 ~20km)

3. For each location:
   - Call OpenWeather API or Pakistan Meteorological Department API
   - Get 5-day forecast

4. Check for critical conditions:
   - Temperature < 5°C → Frost alert for wheat/cotton
   - Rainfall > 50mm → Flood warning
   - High humidity (>80%) + temp 25-30°C → Fungal disease risk
   - Temperature > 40°C → Heat stress alert

5. For matching conditions:
   - Call Gemini to generate context-aware advice:
     "Weather alert for {location}: {conditions}. 
     Farmers growing {crops} should: [generate 2-3 actionable tips]"

6. Create notifications in Firestore 'notifications' collection
7. Send FCM push notification
8. Send SMS via Twilio for high-priority alerts (frost, flood)

9. Log all alerts to weather_logs collection

Weather Integration:
- Use OpenWeather API (free tier: 1000 calls/day)
- API key stored in Cloud Functions environment variables
- Fallback to cached data if API fails
```

### **Agent 6: Coordinator/Orchestrator Agent**
**Purpose:** Manage agent workflow, logging, and error handling

**Implementation as Cloud Function:**
```javascript
// Function: coordinatorAgent
// Trigger: Called by ingestAgent after report creation

Input: { reportId: string }

Orchestration Logic:
1. Check report status in Firestore

2. If status = 'processing':
   a. Call diagnosticAgent(reportId)
   b. Wait for completion (max 30 seconds)
   c. Log: "Diagnosis phase completed"
   d. Update report status

3. If status = 'diagnosed':
   a. Call actionPlannerAgent(reportId) AND marketplaceAgent(reportId) in parallel
   b. Use Promise.all() to wait for both
   c. Log: "Treatment plan and marketplace ready"
   d. Update report status to 'complete'

4. Error Handling:
   - Any agent fails → Retry 3 times with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s)
   - All retries fail → Update status to 'error'
   - Log detailed error to agents_logs
   - Send user-friendly error message

5. On Success:
   - Trigger FCM notification: "Your crop diagnosis is ready!"
   - Optional: Send SMS summary
   - Log final status

6. Throughout execution:
   - Update report.lastAgentAction with current step
   - Maintain detailed agents_logs entries:
     {
       agentName: string,
       action: string,
       reportId: string,
       input: object,
       output: object,
       duration: number, // milliseconds
       status: 'success' | 'error',
       error?: string,
       timestamp: serverTimestamp()
     }

7. Return complete report object to frontend

Performance Requirements:
- Total execution time: < 45 seconds (target: 20-30 seconds)
- Parallel execution where possible
- Graceful degradation (if marketplace fails, still return diagnosis)
```

Prompt 5: 
What is agentic approach or thing in this app? Is there any?

Prompt 6:
Make ensure that these features implemented and working well: gents (roles & responsibilities)

Image & Symptom Ingest Agent — accepts image + farmer text, pre-processes (resize, basic filters), returns embeddings & metadata.

Diagnostic Agent (RAG + Vision) — uses RAG over curated crop docs + pretrained vision reasoning (Gemini Vision or ML Kit) to output likely disease/pest + confidence and ask clarifying Qs.

Action Planner Agent — builds costed treatment plan (materials, steps, time, safety notes). Can break large tasks into step lists and schedule reminders.

Marketplace Agent — finds nearby suppliers/buyers using geolocation + marketplace DB, negotiates (templated messages), or creates listings.

Coordinator / Orchestrator Agent — assigns tasks between agents, logs decisions to Firestore for audit, triggers Cloud Functions for notifications.

bookmark_border

You can use Firebase Authentication to sign in a user by sending an SMS message to the user's phone. The user signs in using a one-time code contained in the SMS message.

The easiest way to add phone number sign-in to your app is to use FirebaseUI, which includes a drop-in sign-in widget that implements sign-in flows for phone number sign-in, as well as password-based and federated sign-in. This document describes how to implement a phone number sign-in flow using the Firebase SDK.

Phone numbers that end users provide for authentication will be sent and stored by Google to improve our spam and abuse prevention across Google services, including but not limited to Firebase. Developers should ensure they have appropriate end-user consent prior to using the Firebase Authentication phone number sign-in service. Before you begin If you haven't already, copy the initialization snippet from the Firebase console to your project as described in Add Firebase to your JavaScript project. Security concerns Authentication using only a phone number, while convenient, is less secure than the other available methods, because possession of a phone number can be easily transferred between users. Also, on devices with multiple user profiles, any user that can receive SMS messages can sign in to an account using the device's phone number.

If you use phone number based sign-in in your app, you should offer it alongside more secure sign-in methods, and inform users of the security tradeoffs of using phone number sign-in.

Enable Phone Number sign-in for your Firebase project To sign in users by SMS, you must first enable the Phone Number sign-in method for your Firebase project:

In the Firebase console, open the Authentication section. On the Sign-in Method page, enable the Phone Number sign-in method. Optional: On the Settings page, set a policy on the regions to which you want to allow or deny SMS messages to be sent. Setting an SMS region policy can help protect your apps from SMS abuse. On the same page, if the domain that will host your app isn't listed in the OAuth redirect domains section, add your domain. Note that localhost is not allowed as a hosted domain for the purposes of phone auth. Set up the reCAPTCHA verifier Before you can sign in users with their phone numbers, you must set up Firebase's reCAPTCHA verifier. Firebase uses reCAPTCHA to prevent abuse, such as by ensuring that the phone number verification request comes from one of your app's allowed domains.

You don't need to manually set up a reCAPTCHA client; when you use the Firebase SDK's RecaptchaVerifier object, Firebase automatically creates and handles any necessary client keys and secrets.

The RecaptchaVerifier object supports invisible reCAPTCHA, which can often verify the user without requiring any user action, as well as the reCAPTCHA widget, which always requires user interaction to complete successfully.

The underlying rendered reCAPTCHA can be localized to the user's preference by updating the language code on the Auth instance before rendering the reCAPTCHA. The aforementioned localization will also apply to the SMS message sent to the user, containing the verification code.

Web Web

import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";

const auth = getAuth(); auth.languageCode = 'it'; // To apply the default browser preference instead of explicitly setting it. // auth.useDeviceLanguage(); Use invisible reCAPTCHA To use an invisible reCAPTCHA, create a RecaptchaVerifier object with the size parameter set to invisible, specifying the ID of the button that submits your sign-in form. For example:

Web Web

import { getAuth, RecaptchaVerifier } from "firebase/auth";

const auth = getAuth(); window.recaptchaVerifier = new RecaptchaVerifier(auth, 'sign-in-button', { 'size': 'invisible', 'callback': (response) => { // reCAPTCHA solved, allow signInWithPhoneNumber. onSignInSubmit(); } }); Use the reCAPTCHA widget To use the visible reCAPTCHA widget, create an element on your page to contain the widget, and then create a RecaptchaVerifier object, specifying the ID of the container when you do so. For example:

Web Web

import { getAuth, RecaptchaVerifier } from "firebase/auth";

const auth = getAuth(); window.recaptchaVerifier = new RecaptchaVerifier(auth, 'recaptcha-container', {}); Optional: Specify reCAPTCHA parameters You can optionally set callback functions on the RecaptchaVerifier object that are called when the user solves the reCAPTCHA or the reCAPTCHA expires before the user submits the form:

Web Web

import { getAuth, RecaptchaVerifier } from "firebase/auth";

const auth = getAuth(); window.recaptchaVerifier = new RecaptchaVerifier(auth, 'recaptcha-container', { 'size': 'normal', 'callback': (response) => { // reCAPTCHA solved, allow signInWithPhoneNumber. // ... }, 'expired-callback': () => { // Response expired. Ask user to solve reCAPTCHA again. // ... } }); Optional: Pre-render the reCAPTCHA If you want to pre-render the reCAPTCHA before you submit a sign-in request, call render:

Web Web

recaptchaVerifier.render().then((widgetId) => { window.recaptchaWidgetId = widgetId; }); After render resolves, you get the reCAPTCHA's widget ID, which you can use to make calls to the reCAPTCHA API:

Web Web

const recaptchaResponse = grecaptcha.getResponse(recaptchaWidgetId); Send a verification code to the user's phone To initiate phone number sign-in, present the user an interface that prompts them to provide their phone number, and then call signInWithPhoneNumber to request that Firebase send an authentication code to the user's phone by SMS:

Get the user's phone number.

Legal requirements vary, but as a best practice and to set expectations for your users, you should inform them that if they use phone sign-in, they might receive an SMS message for verification and standard rates apply.

Call signInWithPhoneNumber, passing to it the user's phone number and the RecaptchaVerifier you created earlier. Web Web

import { getAuth, signInWithPhoneNumber } from "firebase/auth";

const phoneNumber = getPhoneNumberFromUserInput(); const appVerifier = window.recaptchaVerifier;

const auth = getAuth(); signInWithPhoneNumber(auth, phoneNumber, appVerifier) .then((confirmationResult) => { // SMS sent. Prompt user to type the code from the message, then sign the // user in with confirmationResult.confirm(code). window.confirmationResult = confirmationResult; // ... }).catch((error) => { // Error; SMS not sent // ... }); If signInWithPhoneNumber results in an error, reset the reCAPTCHA so the user can try again:

grecaptcha.reset(window.recaptchaWidgetId);

// Or, if you haven't stored the widget ID: window.recaptchaVerifier.render().then(function(widgetId) { grecaptcha.reset(widgetId); }); Note: See Firebase Authentication Limits for applicable usage limits and quotas. The signInWithPhoneNumber method issues the reCAPTCHA challenge to the user, and if the user passes the challenge, requests that Firebase Authentication send an SMS message containing a verification code to the user's phone.

To prevent abuse, Firebase enforces a limit on the number of SMS messages that can be sent to a single phone number within a period of time. If you exceed this limit, phone number verification requests might be throttled. If you encounter this issue during development, use a different phone number for testing, or try the request again later. Sign in the user with the verification code After the call to signInWithPhoneNumber succeeds, prompt the user to type the verification code they received by SMS. Then, sign in the user by passing the code to the confirm method of the ConfirmationResult object that was passed to signInWithPhoneNumber's fulfillment handler (that is, its then block). For example:

Web Web

const code = getCodeFromUserInput(); confirmationResult.confirm(code).then((result) => { // User signed in successfully. const user = result.user; // ... }).catch((error) => { // User couldn't sign in (bad verification code?) // ... }); If the call to confirm succeeded, the user is successfully signed in.

Get the intermediate AuthCredential object If you need to get an AuthCredential object for the user's account, pass the verification code from the confirmation result and the verification code to PhoneAuthProvider.credential instead of calling confirm:

var credential = firebase.auth.PhoneAuthProvider.credential(confirmationResult.verificationId, code); Then, you can sign in the user with the credential:

firebase.auth().signInWithCredential(credential); Test with fictional phone numbers You can set up fictional phone numbers for development via the Firebase console. Testing with fictional phone numbers provides these benefits:

Test phone number authentication without consuming your usage quota. Test phone number authentication without sending an actual SMS message. Run consecutive tests with the same phone number without getting throttled. This minimizes the risk of rejection during App store review process if the reviewer happens to use the same phone number for testing. Test readily in development environments without any additional effort, such as the ability to develop in an iOS simulator or an Android emulator without Google Play Services. Write integration tests without being blocked by security checks normally applied on real phone numbers in a production environment. Fictional phone numbers must meet these requirements:

Make sure you use phone numbers that are indeed fictional, and do not already exist. Firebase Authentication does not allow you to set existing phone numbers used by real users as test numbers. One option is to use 555 prefixed numbers as US test phone numbers, for example: +1 650-555-3434 Phone numbers have to be correctly formatted for length and other constraints. They will still go through the same validation as a real user's phone number. You can add up to 10 phone numbers for development. Use test phone numbers/codes that are hard to guess and change those frequently. Create fictional phone numbers and verification codes In the Firebase console, open the Authentication section. In the Sign in method tab, enable the Phone provider if you haven't already. Open the Phone numbers for testing accordion menu. Provide the phone number you want to test, for example: +1 650-555-3434. Provide the 6-digit verification code for that specific number, for example: 654321. Add the number. If there's a need, you can delete the phone number and its code by hovering over the corresponding row and clicking the trash icon. Manual testing You can directly start using a fictional phone number in your application. This allows you to perform manual testing during development stages without running into quota issues or throttling. You can also test directly from an iOS simulator or Android emulator without Google Play Services installed.

When you provide the fictional phone number and send the verification code, no actual SMS is sent. Instead, you need to provide the previously configured verification code to complete the sign in.

On sign-in completion, a Firebase user is created with that phone number. The user has the same behavior and properties as a real phone number user, and can access Realtime Database/Cloud Firestore and other services the same way. The ID token minted during this process has the same signature as a real phone number user.

Because the ID token for the fictional phone number has the same signature as a real phone number user, it is important to store these numbers securely and to continuously recycle them. Another option is to set a test role via custom claims on these users to differentiate them as fake users if you want to further restrict access.

Integration testing In addition to manual testing, Firebase Authentication provides APIs to help write integration tests for phone auth testing. These APIs disable app verification by disabling the reCAPTCHA requirement in web and silent push notifications in iOS. This makes automation testing possible in these flows and easier to implement. In addition, they help provide the ability to test instant verification flows on Android.

Make sure app verification is not disabled for production apps and that no fictional phone numbers are hardcoded in your production app. On web, set appVerificationDisabledForTesting to true before rendering the firebase.auth.RecaptchaVerifier. This resolves the reCAPTCHA automatically, allowing you to pass the phone number without manually solving it. Note that even though reCAPTCHA is disabled, using a non-fictional phone number will still fail to complete sign in. Only fictional phone numbers can be used with this API.

// Turn off phone auth app verification. firebase.auth().settings.appVerificationDisabledForTesting = true;

var phoneNumber = "+16505554567"; var testVerificationCode = "123456";

// This will render a fake reCAPTCHA as appVerificationDisabledForTesting is true. // This will resolve after rendering without app verification. var appVerifier = new firebase.auth.RecaptchaVerifier('recaptcha-container'); // signInWithPhoneNumber will call appVerifier.verify() which will resolve with a fake // reCAPTCHA response. firebase.auth().signInWithPhoneNumber(phoneNumber, appVerifier) .then(function (confirmationResult) { // confirmationResult can resolve with the fictional testVerificationCode above. return confirmationResult.confirm(testVerificationCode) }).catch(function (error) { // Error; SMS not sent // ... }); Visible and invisible mock reCAPTCHA app verifiers behave differently when app verification is disabled:

Visible reCAPTCHA: When the visible reCAPTCHA is rendered via appVerifier.render(), it automatically resolves itself after a fraction of a second delay. This is equivalent to a user clicking the reCAPTCHA immediately upon rendering. The reCAPTCHA response will expire after some time and then auto-resolve again. Invisible reCAPTCHA: The invisible reCAPTCHA does not auto-resolve on rendering and instead does so on the appVerifier.verify()call or when the button anchor of the reCAPTCHA is clicked after a fraction of a second delay. Similarly, the response will expire after some time and will only auto-resolve either after the appVerifier.verify() call or when the button anchor of the reCAPTCHA is clicked again. Whenever a mock reCAPTCHA is resolved, the corresponding callback function is triggered as expected with the fake response. If an expiration callback is also specified, it will trigger on expiration.

Next steps After a user signs in for the first time, a new user account is created and linked to the credentials—that is, the user name and password, phone number, or auth provider information—the user signed in with. This new account is stored as part of your Firebase project, and can be used to identify a user across every app in your project, regardless of how the user signs in.

In your apps, the recommended way to know the auth status of your user is to set an observer on the Auth object. You can then get the user's basic profile information from the User object. See Manage Users.

In your Firebase Realtime Database and Cloud Storage Security Rules, you can get the signed-in user's unique user ID from the auth variable, and use it to control what data a user can access.

You can allow users to sign in to your app using multiple authentication providers by linking auth provider credentials to an existing user account.

To sign out a user, call signOut:

Web Web

import { getAuth, signOut } from "firebase/auth";

const auth = getAuth(); signOut(auth).then(() => { // Sign-out successful. }).catch((error) => { // An error happened. });

According to this my following aim, what things are left? An agentic multi-agent app for smallholder farmers that: (1) diagnoses crop problems from farmer images + short text, (2) produces step-by-step treatment + costed action plans (RAG + domain knowledge), (3) connects farmers to nearby input suppliers/buyers and logistics, and (4) proactively alerts/automates actions based on weather/market signals. High impact for Pakistan, matches your agentic RAG and voice/agent experience, and fits Firebase Studio’s agentic dev flow (Gemini + Firebase)

Agents (roles & responsibilities)

Image & Symptom Ingest Agent — accepts image + farmer text, pre-processes (resize, basic filters), returns embeddings & metadata.

Diagnostic Agent (RAG + Vision) — uses RAG over curated crop docs + pretrained vision reasoning (Gemini Vision or ML Kit) to output likely disease/pest + confidence and ask clarifying Qs.

Action Planner Agent — builds costed treatment plan (materials, steps, time, safety notes). Can break large tasks into step lists and schedule reminders.

Marketplace Agent — finds nearby suppliers/buyers using geolocation + marketplace DB, negotiates (templated messages), or creates listings.

Coordinator / Orchestrator Agent — assigns tasks between agents, logs decisions to Firestore for audit, triggers Cloud Functions for notifications.

Firebase Studio / Firebase services mapping (concrete)

Firebase Studio (workspace & agents) — development environment & builtin Gemini assistance. Firebase

Firestore — store users, reports, agents’ logs, marketplace listings, knowledge index metadata. Google Cloud

Firebase Storage — store uploaded crop images and media.

Cloud Functions (or Functions in Firebase Studio) — host server logic: call Gemini APIs, run vector search/embeddings, image pre-processing, integrate third-party APIs (weather/market), and run scheduled jobs. Firebase

Auth — farmer accounts (phone/email), role management (farmer, extension agent, buyer).

Firebase Hosting — deploy single-page app demo.

Firebase Cloud Messaging / Notifications — push reminders and urgent alerts.

Emulators & Test Harness — use Studio’s emulators for quick end-to-end tests.

Minimal Viable Product (MVP) — what to deliver by Oct 10

User flow: Farmer signs up → uploads crop image + short text → receives diagnosis + 3-step treatment plan → optional marketplace listing/contact.

Backend: Firestore collections + Cloud Functions connecting to a small RAG knowledge bundle (crop guide PDFs, extension notes).

Agents: At least 2 working agents: (a) Diagnostic Agent (image+RAG), (b) Planner Agent (action plan + notification). Coordinator agent logs decisions.

UI: Clean web UI on Firebase Hosting with demo data and an admin view to see agent logs.

Error: A param property was accessed directly with params.id. params is now a Promise and should be unwrapped with React.use() before accessing properties of the underlying params object. In this version of Next.js direct access to param properties is still supported to facilitate migration but in a future version you will be required to unwrap params with React.use(). at createConsoleErro


Prompt 41:
Still this: Analyze whole code, think like a professional developer and identify the bug, if i need to do anything tell me: FirebaseError: Missing or insufficient permissions.
