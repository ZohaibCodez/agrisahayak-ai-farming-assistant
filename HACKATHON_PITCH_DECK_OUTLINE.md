## SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM
**Pakistani Farmers Are Struggling**

### Statistics That Matter:
- 📉 **30-40% Crop Loss** due to delayed disease detection
- 👨‍🌾 **1 Expert per 5,000 Farmers** - severe shortage of agricultural experts
- 🌐 **70% Language Barrier** - farmers speak Urdu/Punjabi, not English
- ⏱️ **2-3 Days Wait** for expert consultation
- 💰 **$3 Billion Annual Loss** in Pakistan due to crop diseases

### The Pain Points:
1. No instant diagnosis when disease appears
2. Can't identify pests/diseases from images
3. Don't know which products to buy (names in English)
4. Can't find nearby suppliers
5. Miss weather warnings (no timely alerts)
